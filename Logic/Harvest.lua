-- a capability check and the module degrades to doing less rather than
-- erroring. A missed sample is a missed sample; a Lua error mid-raid is not.

-- go with them: inside a dungeon the client may hand an addon a name, a level
-- or a quantity that it is not willing to have inspected. The value looks
-- ordinary -- type() answers "string" -- but comparing, concatenating or
-- formatting it raises on the spot, and it raises in this addon's own stack
-- frame, because the execution reading it is tainted by this addon.
--
-- Seen in Ragefire Chasm on 2026-09-22. UnitName("target") came back
-- clean from its pcall and `name == ""` two lines later was the error. The
-- pcall around the call never had a chance: nothing was wrong with the call.
--
-- So nothing that came out of the client is touched outside a pcall. Every
-- such value goes through one of these two, where the reading itself is what
-- happens inside the pcall, and callers get back either an ordinary Lua value
