-- Blackthornes Farmer -- Logic/Goals.lua
-- Gathering goals (2026-09-27): pick a material and a number, and the
-- Goals panel counts you toward it.
--
-- A goal is "have this many", counted from your bags (and your bank, if you
-- tick it), not "loot this many from now": 6 Copper Ore already in the bags
-- count toward 40. So the count is read from the client whenever the bags
-- change, and never kept by hand.
--
-- Only a rise out in the world counts as gathering. With the bank, a mailbox,
-- a vendor, the auction house or a trade open the count still follows the
-- bags, but that change is not loot: it floats nothing and does not feed the
-- pace.
--
-- The pace is worked out from the gathering itself: how many came in, over
-- the time between one loot and the next, with any gap over five minutes
-- counted as five (a break, not slow farming).
--
-- Goals live in BlackthornesFarmerDB.goals. They are your plan, not recorded
-- loot, so removing one removes nothing the addon measured.
--
-- That table is the account's, but a count is one character's bags, so a goal
-- belongs to the character that set it (goal.owner) and shows only there. A
-- goal saved before goals had owners shows on every character, and none of
-- them finishes it until one gathers toward it or changes it, which makes it
-- that character's.
